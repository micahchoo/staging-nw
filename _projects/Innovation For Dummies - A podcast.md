# Innovation For Dummies - A podcast

This podcast was made by our class in 2019 - I was editing audio and video and writing the script.
The hosts of the podcast, Abhishek and Saili, aim to unravel the concept of innovation and how it is applied and adapted in various settings, given the limitations of time, resources, and people. They point out the disparities that exist in India and the struggles they face when trying to apply western theories and models in their context.

Here are some key points:

1.  **Understanding Innovation:** The hosts start by defining innovation according to Steven Shapiro, as about survival and adaptation. They further mention the importance of innovation in delivering social impact and business growth.
    
2.  **Social vs. Commercial Innovation:** They highlight the difference between commercial and social innovation, with the former often aimed at monopolizing the market, while the latter is aimed at creating sustainable transformations in society. They bring up examples of individuals who have worked in these areas and point out how social innovation often faces different constraints than commercial innovation.
    
3.  **Traits of Innovative Organizations:** These include being inclusive and people-oriented, working in multidisciplinary setups, encouraging experimentation, and understanding the context and people involved in the innovation process.
    
4.  **Pitfalls of Innovation:** They mention how the term "innovation" is often misused and highlight examples of innovations that failed due to lack of context consideration. They also point out the potential costs of innovation, including increasing socio-economic disparities, and instances where initiatives in the name of innovation have led to negative effects on certain communities.
    
5.  **Inclusive Innovation:** The hosts stress the need for inclusive innovation that takes into account the pluralities of Indian society and works towards narrowing socio-economic and ecological gaps. They suggest that linear thinking from commercial innovation often doesn't apply to social challenges and emphasize the unpredictability and messiness of change in the social impact sector.
