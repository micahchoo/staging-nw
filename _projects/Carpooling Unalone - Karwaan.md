## Why hasn’t carpooling gained popularity in India?

We carried out some secondary research to find possible answers to this question. We looked at various aspects:

- What do potential carpoolers want?
- Who are the kinds of passengers that would potentially pool a ride?
- What are the incentives for someone to pool a ride?
- What are some reasons not to?
- What were the challenges to Carpooling in the pre-technology era?
- How many of these were solved by Technology?
- What remains to be solved?
- Since most of these papers were from elsewhere, what were the defining factors in India?

## Key Findings:

1. **Aspirational value of a car:** Cars are seen as a status symbol in society, and owning one is often an aspiration.

2. **Safety:** The inherent danger of getting into a stranger’s car is ever-present, especially in India.

3. **Inconvenience:** Factors like maintaining pool discipline, negotiating pick-up points, potential delay due to co-poolers, and longer routes are a source of inconvenience.

4. **Legal Ambiguity:** Despite restrictions on private vehicles from undertaking commercial business, many carpooling platforms are running in India. This has kept prices low, but has led to enforcement actions from the government.

5. **Lack of Awareness:** Many people are not aware of formalized platform-based carpooling.

6. **Social Barriers:** Factors related to class differences, building trust among poolmates, and the responsibility of negotiating a system of timing and splitting costs can also hinder carpooling.

## Successful Carpooling Environments in India

Apps like Quick Ride, Ho Ho rides and Wunder are promoting carpooling among IT professionals in Bangalore. Our interviews showed us factors boosting this trend:

- Cohort Travel
- Part of corporate culture
- Platform tie-ups
- Common destination
- Shared context
- Regular Commute and Routine times

This led us to understand the importance of 'cohort/community travelling' as a key component in carpooling. Trust, shared community and culture became a significant part of our system design.

As Vivek Kumar, a marketing manager at Wunder, stated:

>“We are in for a longer game, we are here to build a culture and community of carpoolers than looking at profitability at the moment”.

## The Principles for Our System Design

1. It had to be fun
2. It had to be community-based

We initially came up with a [prototype](https://medium.com/exploring-ride-sharing-systems-at-scale/creating-a-community-based-carpooling-system-afbac6b732cb) as a team. I also created my own prototype using Figma, available [here](https://www.figma.com/file/lGZklLSlFA2yjPxmcyykud/Karwaan?node-id=1%3A2318).
