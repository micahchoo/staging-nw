 The purpose was to make archives more democratic in the described and annotated ways. The core was to achieve this using the W3C Web Annotation Standard and to see how different archival description standards might translate with the web annotation.

In the video, the team demos the tool, and I discuss the platform design with the participants. (2:03:00 - 2:12:00)

## The Process

Milli started as a platform to connect different archives to each other and open them up to annotation. We were piloting the platform with metadata from the [NCBS Archives](https://archives.ncbs.res.in/collections). We considered various aspects, starting with user stories based on the following hypothesis:

> As a [type of user or role], I want [some goal] so that [some reason].

### Milli User Stories

1. As a science student, I want better finding aids to browse the metadata descriptions of different archives.
2. As a research associate, I want to add tags to specific archive item metadata descriptions so that I can easily browse my tags later.
3. As a researcher, I want to add text comments to specific archive item metadata descriptions to quote them in my research paper.
4. As a science journalist, I want to link two archival items with custom relationships to analyze emerging patterns for stories.
5. As an archivist, I want to create categories to organize archival research.
6. As the owner of the Milli platform, I want to create new sites/accounts to manage contracts, policies, and interactions with other institutions, archives, or formal organizations.
7. As the technical administrator of Milli, I want to set up background processes or jobs for data exchange, parsing, or other adapters.
8. As the site (account) administrator of Milli, I want to create and manage users.
9. As a site administrator of Milli, I want to approve or reject annotations (tags, comments) to prevent spam.

Our overarching goal was to create interconnections among diverse archives, be it private, institutional, governmental, or personal. We aimed to foster a community of users who annotate, discover, and narrate stories using collections of annotations, thus transforming the archival landscape into an interactive space.

During our user research, we gleaned several key insights that shaped our design:

1. **Focus on Metadata:** Most archives prefer to share only their metadata. Consequently, we aimed to create an interface that enabled users to annotate this metadata.

2. **Flexible Annotation Mechanism:** Users might want to annotate different archival items for various purposes. This was also highlighted in the W3C Standards for Web Annotation.

3. **Metadata Standard Agnostic:** We observed that different archives employ different metadata standards, such as EAD, FOAF, and Dublincore. As a result, our import mechanism needed to be agnostic to these varying standards.



The idea was to build interconnections between private, institutional, governmental, and personal archives. Through our user research, we identified these insights

1.  Most archives will only share their metadata, so the annotation target has to be metadata
2.  Users might want to annotate different archival items for different purposes (this mechanism was also highlighted in the W3C Standards for Web Annotation)
3.  Different archives will use different standards for the metadata - eg. EAD, FOAF, Dublincore etc. This meant that importing of metadata for partners would have to be agnostic to these standards
4.  Users annotate -> Users Discover Annotations -> Users Annotate more OR -> Users narrate stories using collections of annotations

Of these, I worked on making a mechanism for annotating an archival object as well as how the archival object looked. I also helped design the information visible on each search result.

## On the archival object page, my priorities were to show

1.  Which fields are annotable,
2.  what fields act as access points to other objects in the archive
3.  What is the hierarchy of the current object
4.  Create user flows for private curation, notetaking, and collection - including a way to subscribe to new annotations, make a private annotation and save objects to a jhola(“metaphor for a bag”)

## Annotation Widget

My work also involved designing the Annotation Widget, a vital tool for user interaction, allowing:

-   Structuring each annotation as a key-value pair, and
-   Annotation of the entire object as well as parts of the object’s description.

## Search Hits

Mocking up what search results would look like
{:.figcaption}

In order to enrich the user experience, I optimized the search hits by:

-   Using the metadata categorization from the Archival Object page to add more context in an accordion on the results card, and
-   Indicating whether the search had hits on the annotations in the object.
