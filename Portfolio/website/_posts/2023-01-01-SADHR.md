 In my internship with Habba in 2018, I undertook the task of redesigning their website to improve user experience and highlight the unique aspects of their platform. The goal was to create an engaging interface that effectively communicated the values and offerings of Habba, a platform dedicated to supporting artisans and promoting handmade products.

Welcome to the South Asian Digital History repository! This project is dedicated to cataloging libraries and historical records related to South Asia, with a particular emphasis on Digital History. 

## Overview

The repository encompasses two main aspects of Digital History:
1. **History of the Digital**: This includes the exploration of technology and the internet and their interaction with socio-cultural phenomena within South Asia.
2. **Digitized History**: As archives throughout South Asia transition to digitization, formerly inaccessible cultural and historical artifacts become available for study and exploration.

## Contents

The repository contains curated links and resources that offer insights into Digital History within the specific context of South Asia. It covers various topics such as:
- Digital humanities
- Data visualization
- History of the region

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from individuals who share our passion for uncovering narratives of South Asian digital history. The project operates under the ethos that formalizing archives from a top-down approach often perpetuates colonial ideas regarding knowledge ownership and profit. As such, the archives included here span a broad spectrum in terms of content and origin.
