# Workshops, Classes, and Panels
### [Seeing, Being, Doing: small-letter ‘d’ design - 4 Month design studio](/portfolio/presentation/teaching/2022-12-01-Facilitating-a-Design-Studio-Overview) - 2022
A 4-month studio module for 22 undergraduate interaction design students. Held in two+ sites in India, we explored embodied design praxis. What does it mean to design artistically? Can a designer respond like an artist to their context and allow for more freeform exploration of designed outputs than industry dogma <+ with Navin and Siddhant>

### Beyond Listening - 5 day masterclass- 2022
A 5-day design masterclass on the interface of publishing with non-textual media, what are the politics of sound? How do oral narratives and audial aesthetics come together? How is this important in India, where specifically English read-write-speak literacy is low? This class focused on exploring storytelling through the medium of sound and understanding how sound mediated interactions. Students delved into the world of podcasts, examining the elements of podcast production and the power of sound in storytelling. They also learned about listening, oral history, and different interview methods. The class covered audio editing tools and techniques, allowing students to craft their own audio stories. Additionally, discussions on open source publishing, licenses, and the politics of design were held. The class culminated in a final podcast project, where students planned, produced, and exhibited their own podcasts. Throughout the course, students developed a deep appreciation for the role of sound in storytelling and gained practical skills in audio production and storytelling techniques.*<+ with Bhanu P and Shafali J>*

### [The Imposter Among Us: A Discussion on the effect of new media on politics](https://twitter.com/blnaveen/status/1321689139327066112?s=20&t=sirx2jX9r_3QYdSMChImuA) - **2021**

A discussion facilitated by Paul and me through readings about "How do platforms compel/enable the manufacturing of "truth” and "ignorance"? And what does that mean in the context of live-streaming politicians"

### [Design Beku Townhall](https://twitter.com/DesignBeku/status/1305805491126247424?s=20&t=fWFgayBf_gS-tGYtN90eNQ) - **2021**

A workshop was conducted with a larger collective to arrive at a set of principles for Design Beku. Design Beku is an organization that advocates against the flippant imposition of design thinking and instead practices conscientious design with its collaborators from various communities to design as a collaborative, participatory practice. This townhall was instrumental in giving form to the organization when it was still in its infancy.
