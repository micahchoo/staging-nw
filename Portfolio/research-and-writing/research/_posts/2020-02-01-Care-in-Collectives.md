Archetypes of care are roles that individuals take within collectives, embodying various care practices that nurture our shared environments. They reflect the notion of co-authoring, where every individual in a collective contributes to the overall narrative, and nothing is put forth without collective input.

This extends beyond human contributors; non-humans play significant roles too. The flora, fauna, and even the technological entities in our environment are part of this care system, each bringing unique contributions to the collective narrative.

### Amor Mundi: Love of the World

Drawing inspiration from Hannah Arendt’s concept of 'amor mundi', or love of the world, archetypes of care place emphasis on nurturing the world we inhabit. It is about the extrasubjective “web” created when individuals come together not for self or communal care, but for worldly care. This act of tending to the world around us, distinct from self-concern or care for the Other, is an ethos deeply aligned with democratic life.

This love for the world involves tending to both material and immaterial conditions, including relationships with each other, nonhumans, and technological entities. In this context, the world is not confined to the human sphere; it encompasses every aspect of life that influences our shared conditions.

### Democratic Practices and Care

Caring for the world in this manner transcends the formal structures of governance; it is about democratic practice in its true essence. It's about everyone - human and non-human - participating in shaping the collective narrative, each contributing their unique perspectives and capacities.

Not by liability but by accountability. It calls for taking responsibility, not because we are bound by legal or contractual obligations, but because we recognize our role within the collective and the impact of our actions on the world.

Understanding that each contributor has unique experiences and capacities is critical to co-authoring the collective narrative. We should strive to include diverse perspectives, acknowledging the specificity of each contributor's context and experiences.

The process of collaboration is constantly in flux, with identities melding and unmelding, and varying perceptions of collaboration across different contexts. As we navigate through these dynamics, we must continually assess and adapt our approaches to collaboration.

Different typologies of collaboration are evident across various spheres, such as job roles, independent collectives, and institutional structures. Each of these typologies presents unique challenges and opportunities for nurturing care practices.
