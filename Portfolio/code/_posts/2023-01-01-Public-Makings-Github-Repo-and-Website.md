This website is a collaborative platform for crowd-sourced projects and ideas that aim to make knowledge and resources more accessible and democratized. It provides a space for public-making - the creation and cultivation of ideas and resources that require collective effort and public engagement.

[Public-Making - For things that need to be made in public, like half-baked wikipedia ideas](https://micahchoo.github.io/Public-Making)

The projects highlighted range from creating a Wikipedia page on Dalit art to building a pattern library for offline stores soliciting personal data. Other projects include exploring the etymology of technology terms to assist in translation, curating a list of digital resources related to South Asian history, and making detailed biographies of Indian authors available to the public. There are also efforts to simplify language learning by compiling a list of common words in various languages.
