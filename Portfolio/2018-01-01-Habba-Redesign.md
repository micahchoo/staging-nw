Project Description: Habba Website Redesign

In my internship with Habba in 2018, I undertook the task of redesigning their website to improve user experience and highlight the unique aspects of their platform. The goal was to create an engaging interface that effectively communicated the values and offerings of Habba, a platform dedicated to supporting artisans and promoting handmade products.

The redesigned website incorporated visually appealing elements such as carousels and product grids to showcase the diverse range of products available. The main focus was to highlight Habba’s three key promises: supporting artisans, ensuring product authenticity, and transparent pricing.

To enhance the user’s browsing experience, I introduced a feature that allowed users to choose from different styles for outfits, specifically kurtas. This customization option provided visitors with a personalized shopping experience.

Furthermore, I included sections on the website to promote other initiatives such as the Habba Bioscope, which aimed to bridge the gap between rural and urban communities through long-term impact projects supported by corporate funds. The website also provided information about Habba’s social responsibility initiatives and employee engagement activities, demonstrating their commitment to holistic development and positive change.

Throughout the website, I emphasized Habba’s dedication to supporting artisans and showcased their products, ensuring customers understood the authenticity and creativity behind each handmade item. Additionally, I incorporated a breakdown of the cost-price for each product, allowing customers to see how their money directly supported the artisans and the production process.

By creating an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface, I aimed to attract conscious consumers who value authentic handmade goods while providing artisans with a platform to showcase their craftsmanship and prosper in the digital age.
