## Overview

The repository encompasses two main aspects of Digital History:
1. **History of the Digital**: This includes the exploration of technology and the internet and their interaction with socio-cultural phenomena within South Asia.
2. **Digitized History**: As archives throughout South Asia transition to digitization, formerly inaccessible cultural and historical artifacts become available for study and exploration.

## Contribution Guidelines

We welcome contributions from individuals who share our passion for uncovering narratives of South Asian digital history. The project operates under the ethos that formalizing archives from a top-down approach often perpetuates colonial ideas regarding knowledge ownership and profit. As such, the archives included here span a broad spectrum in terms of content and origin.

### How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/micahchoo/awesome-digital-history-South-Asia).
2. Read the Guide to Contributing for detailed instructions on how to contribute effectively.
3. Submit your contributions via pull requests, ensuring they align with the project's goals and guidelines.
