title: 'Milli Archive Platform'
caption: An open-source project connecting archives through annotation
description: >
  The Milli platform provides a way to connect different archives through a common 
  cross-annotation platform. Using the W3C Web Annotation Standard, it enables democratic 
  access to archival knowledge and creates bridges between different archival description standards.

## Project Overview

{% include components/featured-quote.html 
  text="Archives are fascinating vessels of history, embodying a rich mosaic of artifacts that range from private letters to copyrighted films. The Milli platform aims to democratize access to these collections through open standards and annotation tools."

The Milli platform began as a project to connect different archives to each other and open them up to annotation. We initially piloted with metadata from the NCBS Archives, with a goal of creating interconnections among diverse archives — whether private, institutional, governmental, or personal. 

The platform fosters a community of users who can annotate, discover, and narrate stories using collections of annotations, transforming the archival landscape into an interactive space.

## The Challenge

{% include components/content-card.html 
  title="Key Challenges" 
  content="- Most archives only share metadata, not full content
- Different archives use different metadata standards
- User intentions vary widely when interacting with archives
- Annotation needs to be both private and collaborative"
  type="tip" 
  accent="green" 
%}

When working with archives, we identified several key challenges:

1. Most institutions are only willing to share metadata, not the full content
2. Each archive has its own metadata standards (EAD, FOAF, Dublin Core, etc.)
3. Users have different intentions when annotating — research, personal collection, teaching, etc.
4. The process of creating manifests and annotations should be intuitive yet powerful

## The Process

### User Research

{% include components/timeline.html 
  events=site.data.milli.timeline
%}

Our user research phase revealed several insights that shaped our design approach:

1. **Focus on Metadata**: Since most archives only share metadata, our interface needed to enable annotation of this metadata rather than the full content.

2. **Flexible Annotation Mechanism**: Users might want to annotate different archival items for various purposes, aligning with the W3C Standards for Web Annotation.

3. **Metadata Standard Agnostic**: With archives using different standards like EAD, FOAF, and Dublin Core, our import mechanism needed to accommodate this diversity.

</a>

### Feature Design

Based on our research, we prioritized these features:

1. Determining which fields are annotable
2. Identifying fields that serve as access points to other objects
3. Clarifying the hierarchy of current objects
4. Creating user flows for private curation, note-taking, and collection

{% include components/before-after.html 
  title="Design Evolution" 
  before_title="Initial Approach" 
  before_content="Our initial design treated all metadata fields equally, which led to confusion about what could be annotated and why." 
  after_title="Final Design" 
  after_content="The final design clearly distinguishes between core metadata, annotable fields, and relational fields that connect to other archives."
%}

## The Solution

The final Milli platform includes:

{% include components/content-tabs.html 
  tabs=site.data.milli.features
%}

### Annotation Widget

My work focused on designing the Annotation Widget, a vital tool that allows users to:

- Structure each annotation as a key-value pair
- Annotate either the entire object or specific parts of the description
- Apply different motivations (commenting, tagging, linking, etc.)


{% assign screenshots = site.data.milli.screenshots %}
{% include components/ui-gallery.html items=screenshots %}

### Search Results Enhancement

To enrich the user experience, I optimized search results by:

- Using metadata categorization from the Archival Object page for context
- Indicating when search hits matched annotations rather than original metadata
- Creating expandable result cards to show the most relevant information first

## Outcomes and Impact

{% include components/key-takeaways.html 
  title="Key Achievements"
  points=site.data.milli.achievements
%}

The Milli platform has been implemented by several archives across India and has received positive feedback for its intuitive interface and powerful annotation capabilities. It has enabled new forms of archival research and collaboration that weren't previously possible.

## Lessons [:Learned](**This is text)

This project taught me several important lessons about designing for archives:

1. **Metadata is Complex**: Archives use deeply nested and interconnected metadata structures that require careful UX consideration
2. **Standards Matter**: Building on established standards like W3C Web Annotation provides a solid foundation
3. **User Intentions Vary**: Different users (researchers, archivists, casual browsers) have vastly different needs
4. **Balance Simplicity and Power**: Interfaces must be simple enough for basic use but allow for advanced operations
