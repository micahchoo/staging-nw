# Visualizing old and new Data from Municipality Reports



- Youtube videos about Urban planning and transportation almost never cover cities from the Global South
- Conversations about Pune are usually about PMC or Pune Municipal Corporation and not enough times about Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation. This makes no sense since they are literally right next to each other and are collectively referred to as Pune
- Reporting from governing bodies in India are often locked up in PDF files
- I wanted an intuitive way for me to understand the data I was reading in these pdf reports
- I have always wanted to play around with Data Visualisations but as a noob this was mainly possible because of two things. Claude allows me to not really code, Evidence allows me to use a static site generator and use CSVs as data source.
