## Overview

The repository encompasses two main aspects of Digital History:
1. **History of the Digital**: This includes the birth of the internet and their interaction with socio-cultural phenomena within South Asia.
2. **Digitized History**: As archives throughout South Asia transition to digitization, formerly inaccessible cultural and historical artifacts become available for study and exploration.
