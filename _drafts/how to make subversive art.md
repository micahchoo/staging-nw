>metadata: Kumar, S. (2015). Contagious memes, viral videos and subversive parody: The grammar of contention on the Indian web. International Communication Gazette, 77(3), 232–247. doi:10.1177/1748048514568758 #subversion

The critique in each of these videos functions through **‘‘doubleness and selfbifurcation’’** (Connery and Combe, 1995: 2) by juxtaposing an implicit voice that

belies the explicit spoken one. Each is a repetition that deviates through an incipient second voice that defamiliarizes, ridicules, and critiques the said phenomenon.  The incongruous juxtapositions of Koechlin’s bruised face with her smile, of Chotu’s promptness alongside his disheveled look and pitiable singing talents and of trigger-happy mafia Dons resolving their rivalries through a nerdy game of cricket quiz are potent arguments about each of those social practices and beliefs that are arguably just as effective as other more traditional modes of argumentation.

These videos about Indian politics satirize political corruption and the obsessive but vacuous discussions

around politics in India by scripting deviations from the form of a funeral elegy and real workplace situations.
