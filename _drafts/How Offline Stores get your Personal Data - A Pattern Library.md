#### Nukkad Shop Billing Machine

I had experiences with these at two places. At place A in bangalore which was inside an isolated gated society and was probably one of the few well-stocked places in a kilometer or two. Place B was on a busy road in a locality with many gated societies nearby. 

They both would ask for my number for the billing process and I refused at both places. After a few months, Place A refused to serve me without the phone number even if I paid with cash and not a digital payment. Place B started to nudge me toward giving my phone number so that I avail of a 10% discount. But I never had to do it.

#### Medplus

Back when I was in Pune, I remember the day Medplus came to Dapodi (circa 2009). From the beginning they offered discounts in exchange for giving your phone number. I remember being surprised that I would be offered a discount if I gave my Mom's number without them seeing her face. Post the demonetization digital payments boom, Medplus (also Apollo) shifted to another strategy which I found out about in Bangalore. They give no UPI QR or an option for UPI payments which is the usual norm. The only available mode of payment is through Paytm. However, you have to first give your Paytm linked number after which you have to put the money in a wallet and then show them the code from your side which they enter and the money is directly cut.

#### QR codes based Menus in Restros and Pubs

I saw these in two places in Bangalore where you could access the menu through the QR code on the table. The menu at both places was built on the same portal (I'll update the name when I find it next). They ask for your phone number. At first, I tried to put in all zeroes. But the next screen said "Please wait while the serving staff tells you the OTP". Now this caused some doubt - was the OTP based on my phone number or the table. If it is for the table, did I need to give my phone number? Also what is the need for a menu that asks for a phone number to view it? The justification given for QR code menus is contactlessness but the ask for a phone number is piggybacking on the familiarity with online platforms doing this for everything.

#### Chaipoint

I went to Chai Point to order a paratha and the working staff at the counter asked if I wanted a chai. I said no, then they told me if I added a chai to my order I would be able to avail of a 20% discount. I agreed. They said they would have to show me how to do it and took me to a table where there was the familiar QR code menu. The QR code scanned popped out a wa.me link which was familiar to me as the whatsapp link. I clicked on it and it took me to the Whatsapp business account for Chai point, with "Hi" typed in the chat box. After I hit send, it gave me another link, which took me to a website where i was asked to enter my name and email(optional). I entered my name and then I was asked for location permission so that I can find this particular store of Chai Point. After finding the store, I have to search and add each item on my order and then add a coupon code to get the 20% discount. The checkout had a payment portal on it as well.
