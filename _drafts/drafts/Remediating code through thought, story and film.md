# Remediating Thought, Story, Film, Code

1. How do you introduce computational thinking in low-literate contexts using non-linear, media-centric programming metaphors?
2. What are the rules and grammar of this metaphor?

### Smallest Narrative Unit

The concept of the smallest narrative unit is an essential aspect of non-linear storytelling. It refers to the individual fragments or elements that, when connected, form a larger narrative. Each fragment has its own significance and contributes to the overall story. Non-linear storytelling often focuses on the interplay and connections between these fragments, allowing the audience to explore various paths and perspectives.

In conclusion, storytelling in non-linear ways breaks away from traditional linear narratives, offering immersive and interactive experiences. Whether through the use of callbacks, Indian stories, virtual reality, new programming languages, or the exploration of the smallest narrative unit, non-linear storytelling expands the boundaries of narrative structure, engaging audiences in new and exciting ways. It challenges our understanding of storytelling conventions and opens up possibilities for innovation and creativity in the art of storytelling.
