A 5-day design masterclass on the interface of publishing with non-textual media, what are the politics of sound? How do oral narratives and audial aesthetics come together? How is this important in India, where specifically English read-write-speak literacy is low? This class focused on exploring storytelling through the medium of sound and understanding how sound mediated interactions. Students delved into the world of podcasts, examining the elements of podcast production and the power of sound in storytelling. They also learned about listening, oral history, and different interview methods. The class covered audio editing tools and techniques, allowing students to craft their own audio stories. Additionally, discussions on open source publishing, licenses, and the politics of design were held.

### [Technofutures from Bidar](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/publication/2021-02-01-Compost-Magazine-Technofutures-from-Bidar/)

Published in Compost.Mag This piece is a group reflection of a project run in Bidar, India, to set up a community mesh network facilitated by Living Labs Network and Forum, and Janastu/Servelots.

This local mesh network was to act as an intranet of local informal archives that would collectively function as a knowledge network. These archives come from various communities in Bidar and their knowledge practices. During the course of the project, we came to see both the limitations of technology but also the potential of it to catalyse and nurture many more spaces of cultural collaboration. I drew an ilustrated map of bidar with a tiny illustrated episodes and coded the openseadragon+annotrious canvas which would be used to house the annotations

### [Speculative Storytelling in Wayanad](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/artifact/2021-02-01-Speculative-Storytelling-in-Wayanad/)

We wanted to let the children create their own stories using our tapestry tool. However, we also decided to make a sample tapestry just as a test prototype.This was the output of a 5-week course in Wayanad in Kerala, India in the aftermath of the floods of 2018. The Intervention is an educational tool that asks, How it is possible to build aspirations for the future using storytelling?

While studying the Paniya community in Kerala, I was first introduced to the severity of caste issues in India. I have covered all my research about the tribe here [The Disenfranchisement of Adivasis in Kerala](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/2018-01-01-The-Disenfranchisement-of-Adivasis-in-Kerala.md) trying to find ties between their past oppressive histories and their current conditions. 

### [Milli](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/ui-ux%20design/2021-02-01-Milli/)

An open-source project connecting different archives through a common cross-annotation platform The purpose was to make archives more democratic in the described and annotated ways. The core was to achieve this using the W3C Web Annotation Standard and to see how different archival description standards might translate with the web annotation.ur overarching goal was to create interconnections among diverse archives, be it private, institutional, governmental, or personal. We aimed to foster a community of users who annotate, discover, and narrate stories using collections of annotations, thus transforming the archival landscape into an interactive space.

User research and app prototype for Carpooling in India A classroom project doing user research about Carpooling in India leading to a design

To begin the research, we conducted secondary research to gather insights into the preferences and motivations of potential carpoolers, the types of passengers who might be interested in carpooling, the incentives for carpooling, and the challenges faced in the pre-technology era. They also explored the factors specific to India that could affect the adoption of carpooling.

Through further research, including interviews and interactions with IT professionals participating in carpooling, the team discovered that cohort-based carpooling was successful in India, particularly in the IT sector. Factors such as traveling with like-minded individuals, corporate culture support, platform tie-ups with IT firms, shared destinations, shared context beyond carpooling, and regular commute patterns played a crucial role in boosting carpooling adoption within this specific group.[Continue reading Carpooling Unalone - Karwaan](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/ui-ux%20design/user%20research/2018-10-01-Carpooling-Unalone-Karwaan/)

**Navigating the Intersection of Research, Design, and Art: A Journey of Grounded Innovation**

---

**Self-Description:**
I am a Researcher, Designer, and Artist, Crafting Alternatives Rooted in Grounded Narratives.


---

In my journey as a researcher, designer, and artist, I have embraced diverse identities and roles that intersect and intertwine, shaping my approach to innovation and creativity. My work is grounded in narratives from the ground, seeking alternatives to dominant hegemonic structures by co-creating artifacts that envision anti-capitalist, anti-caste, and anti-colonial systems and languages.

I am a grassroots technologist, resilience thinker, and collective urbanist, navigating the complexities of social change through storytelling activism and grounded futurism. As a community mystic and paradigm punk, I challenge existing paradigms and envision new possibilities rooted in care and justice.

My professional journey has taken me from academic institutions to grassroots initiatives, from Janastu to Design Beku, where I have led projects and collaborations that foster innovation in diverse contexts. I blend academic rigor with community engagement, recognizing the transformative power of collaborative action and participatory approaches.

Join me in crafting futures rooted in care and justice, where diverse voices are heard, and alternatives are co-created. Together, we can build a world that embraces complexity, celebrates diversity, and nurtures collective well-being.


I am a researcher, designer, and artist, driven by a deep-seated passion for uncovering narratives from the ground and co-creating alternative systems that challenge hegemonic structures. With a focus on anti-capitalist, anti-caste, and anti-colonial perspectives, I strive to co-make artifacts that envision a more just and equitable world.
