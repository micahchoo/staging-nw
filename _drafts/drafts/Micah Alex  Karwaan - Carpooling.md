Exploring Carpooling Adoption in India and Designing a Community-Based Solution

Duration: 1 Month

My role: User Research

The project aimed to investigate the low adoption rate of carpooling in India, particularly in a price-sensitive market. The research question focused on understanding the reasons behind the lack of popularity of carpooling and identifying potential solutions to overcome the barriers. The project was carried out by a team consisting of Anant, Baishnabi, Micah, Samarth, and Saroj.

To begin the research, the team conducted secondary research to gather insights into the preferences and motivations of potential carpoolers, the types of passengers who might be interested in carpooling, the incentives for carpooling, and the challenges faced in the pre-technology era. They also explored the factors specific to India that could affect the adoption of carpooling.

Based on their findings, the team identified trust and cooperation as significant barriers to carpooling in India. They also discovered successful models in India that fostered trust and cooperation among carpooling participants. With these insights, the team created clusters of factors that influenced carpooling adoption, including the aspirational value of a car, safety concerns, inconvenience, legal ambiguity, lack of awareness, and social barriers.

To narrow down their focus, the team eliminated factors that were not major bottlenecks to carpooling adoption, such as the aspirational value of a car and safety concerns. They also considered the legal ambiguity surrounding carpooling, which required policy changes beyond the scope of their project. This led them to shift their perspective and explore the concept of cohort/community traveling as a dominant factor in carpooling adoption.

Through further research, including interviews and interactions with IT professionals participating in carpooling, the team discovered that cohort-based carpooling was successful in India, particularly in the IT sector. Factors such as traveling with like-minded individuals, corporate culture support, platform tie-ups with IT firms, shared destinations, shared context beyond carpooling, and regular commute patterns played a crucial role in boosting carpooling adoption within this specific group.

With these insights, the team developed the concept of “Karwaan,” a community-based carpooling platform focused on event-based travel in Bangalore. The platform aimed to facilitate ride-sharing to events, cost splitting, and community-building among participants. The team designed user journeys for booking events, pooling rides, and fostering friendships during the journey. They incorporated monetary and non-monetary nudges within the app to incentivize participation and engagement.

The project’s goals encompassed the creation of a userbase, a driverbase, and a community. The team explored potential business partnerships and revenue generation models, considering both monetary and non-monetary nudges to encourage participation.

To validate their solution, the team sought feedback from various stakeholders, including patrons of community spaces, cultural hubs, and carpooling service providers. While the project had some limitations, such as a narrow focus on event-based travel and fragmented user journeys, it provided a foundation for further exploration and refinement of the carpooling concept in India.

Overall, the project aimed to address the low adoption of carpooling in India by designing a community-driven solution that leverages shared interests, trust, and cultural contexts. By focusing on the creation of a cohesive carpooling community, the team aimed to overcome barriers and foster widespread adoption of carpooling as a sustainable and efficient transportation option in India.
