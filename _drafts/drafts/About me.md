In my journey, I wear various hats and embrace diverse identities and roles that intersect and intertwine, shaping my approach to innovation and creativity.

From projects like [**Papad**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/ui-ux%20design/2022-01-01-Papad/), an open-source Audio Annotation and Archival Tool, designed to be used by community-based practitioners, to my involvement as a Research Associate at the [Climate Resource Center](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/) where I interviewed agricultural experts, farmers, and folklore artists, my work follows psths of grassroots-level engagement and technological empowerment.

Through pieces like [**Techno-futures from Bidar**](https://one.compost.digital/fertile-technofutures-from-bidar/), I collaboratively reflected on the potential of technology to catalyze and nurture spaces of cultural collaboration, while acknowledging its limitations.

Projects like [**South Asian Digital History Repository**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/website/2023-02-01-SADHR/) and [**Establishing a Community Network**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2022-01-01-Establishing-a-Community-Based-Generative-Wifi-Mesh-Network/)  were my efforts toward building collaborative platforms and networks aimed at democratizing knowledge and resources.

Through initiatives like [**Speculative Storytelling in Wayanad**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/artifact/2021-02-01-Speculative-Storytelling-in-Wayanad/) and [**Care-full Collectives and their Care Practices**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/publication/2020-01-01-Carefull-Collectives-and-their-Care-Practices/), I explore the power of narratives in envisioning alternate futures and promoting care-driven practices.

Projects like [**Antarsam - Exploring Alternate Histories and Futures**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/miscellaneous/2019-02-01-Antarsam-Exploring-Alternate-Histories-and-Futures/) were a result of my speculative exploration into alternate histories and potential futures, rooted in ecological systems, cultural contexts, and linguistic roots.

Projects such as [**Making The Invisible Visible Around An RO Plant**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2019-02-01-Making-The-Invisible-Visible-Around-An-RO-Plant/) delve into community-centric approaches and the exploration of indigenous knowledge systems.

Designing platforms like [**Milli**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/ui-ux%20design/2021-02-01-Milli/) and [**Papad**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/ui-ux%20design/2022-01-01-Papad/), helped me traverse different open source paradigms towards democratizing access to information and archives. They were also experiences in community-centric technological interventions and participatory design practices.

The [**Lived Experience Archives for Champions of the Disability Sector**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/) was especially helpful in learning the importance of archiving marginalized voices and experiences for the empowerment of communities.

From conducting user research for projects like [**Carpooling Unalone - Karwaan**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/ui-ux%20design/user%20research/2018-10-01-Carpooling-Unalone-Karwaan/) to exploring the impact of caste-based power structures in projects like [**Caste and Education Geospatially in Rural Bihar**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2019-01-01-Caste-and-Education/), I observe and analyze societal dynamics to inform my design and research endeavors.

Autoethnographic Autodidact: My explorations into topics like [**The Disenfranchisement of Paniyas in Kerala**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2018-12-01-The-Disenfranchisement-of-Adivasis-in-Kerala/) and [**Caste and Education Geospatially in Rural Bihar**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2019-01-01-Caste-and-Education/) reflect my journey of self-discovery and learning through immersive experiences and ethnographic research.

[**Remediating code through thought, story, and film**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2021-01-01-Remediating-code-through-thought-story-and-film/) was one of my first made-contemplations on the ethical implications of technology and my efforts to foster responsible technological interventions.

 In [**The Lived Experience Project**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2022-02-20-EnableIndia-LE/) and [**Caste and Education Geospatially in Rural Bihar**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2019-01-01-Caste-and-Education/), I engage in participatory approaches to historical inquiry, amplifying marginalized voices and experiences.

While teaching classes like [**Seeing, Being, Doing: small-letter ‘d’ design - 4 Month design studio**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/presentation/teaching/2022-12-01-Facilitating-a-Design-Studio-Overview) and [**Beyond Listening - 5 day masterclass**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/), I was able to reflect on gradual, iterative progress and continuous learning in my endeavors.
