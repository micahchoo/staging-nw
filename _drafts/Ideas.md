# Ideas

[Social Humans Labels](https://www.docnow.io/social-humans/sh-c-labels.html)  are tools aimed at content creators, enabling them to communicate their preferences regarding how their content is used, shared, and archived. They play a crucial role in digital rights management and align with the ethos of community-building and fostering respect for content creators in the digital space.

The labels' design is inspired by the community garden motif, which serves as a visual reminder of our responsibility to nurture online communities. Like gardeners tending to their plants, we are urged to care for and respect the individuals behind the digital content that populates our online landscapes.

The labels are connected to several other notable initiatives:

1. **#CreativeCommons** - This is a well-known framework that provides content creators with a simple, standardized way to grant copyright permissions to their creative work. It covers permissions for copying and distributing the work, creating derivative works, and making commercial use of the work.

2. **[[Ideas of Care]]** - This principle encourages us to approach our interactions in online spaces with empathy and respect. When applied, it suggests we should consider the implications of our actions on others in our digital communities and strive to act in a manner that respects and supports their wellbeing.

3. **[TK Labels â€“ Local Contexts](https://localcontexts.org/labels/traditional-knowledge-labels/)** - These are part of an initiative that helps Indigenous communities manage their cultural heritage and intellectual property. TK Labels provide a way for these communities to assert their rules and protocols around accessing and using their traditional knowledge.

A project like Terrastories, which is a geostorytelling platform designed to enable local communities to locate and map their own oral storytelling traditions about places of significant meaning or value to them, could make use of these labels or similar "controlled vocabularies". They would allow Terrastories users to clearly communicate how they would like their stories to be used and shared, thus providing them with an extra level of control and security over their cultural heritage. 

In essence, these labels work to democratize the online world, allowing content creators to dictate the terms of how their work is utilized, thereby ensuring they receive the respect and recognition they deserve.
