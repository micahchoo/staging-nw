this led to the development of [[Compost Magazine - Technofutures from Bidar]]

The ambition to 'Common' Digital Spaces is a remarkable stride towards a collective digital experience. However, there is a wide array of inherent challenges yet to be addressed fully. A striking example of these challenges surfaced during our firsthand endeavor in building a [community-owned mesh network in Bidar](https://www.apc.org/en/blog/community-networks-stories-experiences-co-creating-local-knowledge-network). This initiative provoked several questions that deviate from the standard neoliberal assumptions about internetworking. Such undertakings necessitate creating spaces shaped by the people, their local environment, and their interconnected histories.

Notably, championing digital commons can instigate innovative ways to view technology as a supportive pillar, rather than a complete solution. The narrative of technology as a savior is still predominant within the movement, risking the creation of privileged, reductionist spaces that can lack inclusivity.

**How might we reimagine Phygital spaces, Caring Communes, and Fertile Forests that germinate from these cracks?**

Recognizing the opportunities offered by the digital commons requires a simultaneous acknowledgement of its limitations and potential drawbacks. Such awareness enables us to move away from the concept of tech-saviorism, encouraging us to view technology as a tool with its own shortcomings - it's still evolving to embrace complex cultural histories, include diverse narratives of people, places, and events, adapt to alternative visions of "internetworking", and have the patience to engage with non-capitalistic timelines, everyday mundanity, and all associated gray areas. This understanding also brings to light the gaps that technology cannot "fill/solve", underlining the need for technology to provide support, not solutions.

Our recent involvement in a project to establish a local mesh network - acting as an intranet of local archives forming a collective knowledge network - exposed both the constraints of technology and the fertile spaces it interacts with. We aim to share narratives from the field that depict the possibilities and prospective developments envisioned by our network members. This endeavor will also experiment with **co-authoring**. Given that many of our network members use English as a third or fourth language (if at all), and considering the Western-centric nature of writing as a form of documentation, we are keen to explore this format as a part of our ongoing series of experiments.

## Reflections and Thoughts on the piece

- Here is the link to the initial demo that Bhanu and I built using Annotorius and Open Seadragon Library [https://metal-profuse-arch.glitch.me](https://metal-profuse-arch.glitch.me). We needed this to allow multiple annotations to appear on the Map.
- I started by illustrating the map as rather flat, and later learned to use IAM as a reference to enhance the land's texture.
- Siddhant and I then engaged network members, gathering their insights and reflections on the project.
- This approach aligns with the concept of [dialectograms](http://www.dialectograms.com).
- Could [Compost Magazine - Technofutures from Bidar] be a way of contextualizing [[Capstone Reflections - Care-full Collaborations]]?

	* The co-authoring aspect draws from archetypes of care.
	* Archetypes originate from the roles people have assumed in collectives.
	* Does this hint that co-authoring is the only way a collective shares its output?
		* Where do non-humans fit in this narrative?
	* Paul's insights - "The archetypes function well because they can be adapted to different communities. A maintainer in one domain looks vastly different in another."
