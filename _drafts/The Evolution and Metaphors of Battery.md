The term "battery" has carried various meanings throughout history and its application has significantly evolved over time.

## Initial Indications

Historically, the term "battery" has been used to denote groups of Leyden Jars - early devices for storing electric charge. It has also been associated with military equipment, where a battery referred to a set of identical units, like cannon, designed to perform the same function.

Interestingly, in law, "battery" has been used to denote a crime, specifically, unlawful physical contact. This seems to be an exception to the general thematic association of a "battery" as a group or a collection of things serving a purpose.

The word "bat" in sports like cricket and baseball has a distant connection to the term "battery". In baseball, "battery" is used to describe the teaming of the catcher and the pitcher.

## Modern Usage and Future Metaphors

In the current context, the term "battery" is often used to refer to a device that stores energy, typically in an electrochemical form. The naming system seems to be based on structure, reflecting its history of denoting a group or collection of identical units.

One particularly relevant usage in British English is in the context of "battery farming", denoting a system of farming where animals are kept in small cages for intensive rearing. This can serve as a metaphor for modern-day batteries - devices used for the intensive, repetitive storage and release of energy.

## A Comprehensive Definition

Taking into account these historical and current uses, we might define a "battery" as a repetitive group of elements or actions, designed for a specific purpose or effect, often related to striking or building capacity to strike.

## Reframing the Concept

Could we reframe the concept of a battery by focusing on cycles of filling and depleting, akin to reservoirs? This shift could emphasize the dynamic nature of energy storage and use, rather than the static conception of a mere container. This reframing could offer new ways to understand and discuss batteries and their function in our technology-driven world.
