Through pieces like [**Techno-futures from Bidar**](https://one.compost.digital/fertile-technofutures-from-bidar/), I collaboratively reflected on the potential of technology to catalyze and nurture spaces of cultural collaboration, while acknowledging its limitations. Projects like [**South Asian Digital History Repository**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/website/2023-02-01-SADHR/) and [**Establishing a Community Network**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2022-01-01-Establishing-a-Community-Based-Generative-Wifi-Mesh-Network/)  were my efforts toward building collaborative platforms and networks aimed at democratizing knowledge and resources. [**Making The Invisible Visible Around An RO Plant**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2019-02-01-Making-The-Invisible-Visible-Around-An-RO-Plant/) delves into community-centric tech approaches and the exploration of indigenous knowledge systems. Designing platforms like [**Milli**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/ui-ux%20design/2021-02-01-Milli/) and [**Papad**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/ui-ux%20design/2022-01-01-Papad/), helped me traverse different open source paradigms towards democratizing access to information and archives. They were also experiences in community-centric technological interventions and participatory design practices.

From projects like [**Papad**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/ui-ux%20design/2022-01-01-Papad/), an open-source Audio Annotation and Archival Tool, designed to be used by community-based practitioners, to my involvement as a Research Associate at the [Climate Resource Center](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/presentation/2022-01-01-portfolio-workshops-classes-panels-and-publications/#research-associate-climate-resource-center---2022) where I interviewed agricultural experts, farmers, and folklore artists, my work follows paths of grassroots-level engagement and technological empowerment.

In [**Speculative Storytelling in Wayanad**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/design/artifact/2021-02-01-Speculative-Storytelling-in-Wayanad/) and [**Care-full Collectives and their Care Practices**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/publication/2020-01-01-Carefull-Collectives-and-their-Care-Practices/), I explore the power of narratives in envisioning alternate futures and promoting care-driven practices. Narrative projects like [**Antarsam - Exploring Alternate Histories and Futures**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/miscellaneous/2019-02-01-Antarsam-Exploring-Alternate-Histories-and-Futures/) were a result of my speculative exploration into alternate histories and potential futures, rooted in ecological systems, cultural contexts, and linguistic roots.

From exploring the impact of caste-based power structures in projects like [**Caste and Education Geospatially in Rural Bihar**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2019-01-01-Caste-and-Education/), I engage in participatory approaches to historical inquiry. My explorations into topics like [**The Disenfranchisement of Paniyas in Kerala**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2018-12-01-The-Disenfranchisement-of-Adivasis-in-Kerala/) reflect my journey of self-discovery and learning through immersive experiences and ethnographic research. The [**Lived Experience Archives for Champions of the Disability Sector**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/research/2022-02-20-EnableIndia-LE/) was especially helpful in learning the importance of archiving marginalized voices and experiences for the empowerment of communities.

While teaching classes like [**Seeing, Being, Doing: small-letter ‘d’ design - 4 Month design studio**](https://khattamicah.xyz/portfolio/presentation/teaching/2022-12-01-Facilitating-a-Design-Studio-Overview), I was able to reflect on gradual, iterative progress and continuous learning in my endeavors.
