      including tagging, commenting, linking, and semantic relationships.
  - title: Cross-Archive Search
    content: >

      Personal "Jhola" (bag) feature allowing users to save items across archives,
      organize them into collections, and add private notes. These collections
      can be kept private or shared with specific collaborators.
  - title: Metadata Import Framework
    content: >
      Flexible import system that can accommodate various metadata standards and
      map them to a common internal representation. Supports EAD, Dublin Core,
      FOAF, and custom JSON formats.
